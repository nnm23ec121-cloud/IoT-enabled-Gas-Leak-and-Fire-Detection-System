# II. SCOPE OF THE SOLUTION
The proposed system focuses on developing a low-cost and reliable safety monitoring device using a Raspberry Pi Pico, MQ-2 gas sensor, flame sensor, and a buzzer alert mechanism. The solution is designed to continuously detect the presence of smoke, flammable gases, or fire within its surrounding area. It provides instant alerts through an audible buzzer whenever abnormal conditions are detected, allowing users to take immediate action. Additionally, the system can send sensor data to an IoT cloud platform (ThingSpeak) for remote monitoring.

This project covers sensor interfacing, signal processing, and real-time monitoring using embedded programming in Arduino IDE. The system is suitable for small-scale environments such as homes, kitchens, laboratories, and workshops. However, it can be expanded to support IoT-based notifications, additional sensors, and integration with home automation systems for future enhancement.
