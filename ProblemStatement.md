# I. PROBLEM STATEMENT
(PROBLEM STATEMENT-6)

(Q.) Develop an IoT-enabled Gas Leak and Fire Detection System using Raspberry Pi Pico for continuous safety monitoring. Implement instant alerts, Focus on reliability and rapid response.


Gas leaks and fire accidents are major safety hazards in residential, commercial, and industrial environments. Many incidents occur due to the absence of continuous monitoring systems or the delayed detection of harmful gases and flames. Existing safety solutions are often expensive, complex, or lack instant alert capabilities. This increases the risk of property damage, health hazards, and potential loss of life. Therefore, there is a need for a low-cost, efficient, and real-time detection system that can continuously monitor the environment, identify gas leaks or fire at an early stage, and provide immediate alerts to ensure timely response and enhanced safety.
